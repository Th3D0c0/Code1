    <p>You find yourself in a vast, dimly lit chamber. In the center of the room lies a massive, moss-covered boulder.
    </p>
    <p>As you approach the next passage, the ground begins to tremble—the rock is moving.</p>
    <p>With a thunderous roar, the boulder rises… revealing itself to be a slumbering **troll** awakened from its rest.
    </p>
    <p>Its eyes lock onto you. You have seconds to decide: will you run for your life, or stand and fight this towering
        beast?</p>
    <a href="TreasureEnd.html">You choose to fight the troll</a>
